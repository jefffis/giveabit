				<h1>What is Giveab.it?</h1>
				<p>Most of us, <em>at least those who&rsquo;ll be visiting sites like this often</em>, have a few bucks here and there to spare. And the rest of us need those few bucks every now and again. <strong>Some of us need it way more than others</strong>. Rather than buying another coffee or another drink, or if you find yourself with a few dollars extra at the end of the month, why not share it with those who truly need it?</p>
				<p>Giveab.it is a test project that I&rsquo;m working on trying to build a simple way to donate money to charities that need it. <strong>In our busy world we often forget that us in the tech industry have it pretty sweet</strong>, so I want to make something that&rsquo;s also sweet but can do a lot of good for others.</p>
